## About me

I am a fourth year computer science student at Oregon State University. My degree focus is in mobile application and website development. 

Related to my field, I enjoy working with graphics and have experience in OpenGL, OpenSL, and Unreal. I also enjoy solving parallel processing problems as well as optimizing software for hardware.

In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and playing video games. I ski when I can (I grew up in Colorado so of course I ski) and I'm currently learning to play Super Smash Brothers Melee as well osu!. 

## Projects

[Geospatial Analysis for Disaster Planning](https://github.com/bullocgr/capstone) (It's private for now but will become public when the project is finished.)

Currently, I am working with three other computer science students on a project called "Geospatial Analysis for Disaster Planning."

This project will create a geospatial analysis tool that will provide emergency managers with a system level view of the impact of disasters on their jurisdictionâ€™s lifeline networks. This means that our software will help them in creating robust response plans by identifying critical intersections of lifeline networks that may cause bottlenecks in recovery, as well as by providing estimates of time and resources required for debris clearance.

The team is currently working with Dr. Joseph Louis in gathering geodata about roadways in Astoria, OR. We are also working on gathering information about buildings and how likely the are to fall if a disaster were to happen (such as the Cascadia earthquake followed by a tsunami). Once this step is done, we will begin prototyping a toolbox in ArcGIS to see what capabilities it has. If the toolbox allows for algorithms and visualization based on our geodata, then we will move forward in refining what the toolbox will do. This is still open ended but as we find out more about what the toolbox can do our project will become more refined.


[Particle System](https://github.com/bullocgr/visualization/tree/master/particle%20system%20mac)

This project involved creating a particle system that followed some form of real physics. I decided I wanted to make a fountain like object. I created the particles in a particle array that updated every 10 milliseconds. During the update period, the velocity, location, and color of the particles was updated making it look like the particles are moving seemlessly. I also did this project but instead of loading it into an array I utilized parallel processing to load in and update the particles on different thread on the GPU and then loaded it onto the CPU to display. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bullocgr/parallel-programming/tree/master/project7A).


[NASA Picture of the Day](https://github.com/bullocgr/NasaPicOfTheDay)

A group of peers and I decided we wanted to make an application similar to reddit but instead of using the reddit API, we would use the NASA picture of the day API. This API included a picture, when the picture was taken, who took the picture, and some other information about it. Our app showed each picture that was uploaded by the API and when the picture was clicked on, it would show more information about the picture. The application could handle saving the image as well as sharing it with others through the app. The user could also save their favorite pictures directly in the app with a local SQLite database. This way, the user could go back and look at their favorite photos without having to download them to their phone.
